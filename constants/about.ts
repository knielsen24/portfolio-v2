That mindset has been instilled in me from fond childhood memories of working on puzzles with my grandparents and building fully customized prototype concepts with Legos.",

    "Now that I have graduated from Legos, I am passionate about using technology to build web and mobile applications. The way I look at software development is that there is always a problem to be solved, and the missing puzzle pieces are waiting to be discovered. With effort and persistence, one can always find a way to put the pieces together. It is a continuous learning process, but this is what makes software engineering so great.",
